This page describes selected assignments for the class, and includes [videos and complete scores](#student_work) for two examples of the final composition project.

Assignment 3: Analysis
----------------------

There are three parts to this assignment, all based on concepts discussed in class. Please follow the approaches introduced in class as you complete the assignments requested.

### Part A. Three Horn Arrangement of "String of Pearls"

> _Reference score_: commercial arrangement on library reserve (publisher unknown).  
>   
> Please analyze mm. 5 - 13, 19, 20, and 28  
> 1\. How do the two harmony parts function in relation to the melody part?  
> 2\. How do mm. 19, 20, and 28 differ from mm. 5 - 13?  
> 3\. Finally, peruse the overall form of the tune. Describe this form.

### Part B. Full Score Arrangement of "String of Pearls"

> _Reference score_: commercial arrangement on library reserve (publisher unknown).  
>   
> Please convert transposed sax section on score to Reduced Score Format (RSF), which is in concert key, written on treble and bass clefs, with all chord symbols indicated above the block harmony.

### Part C. Four Part Saxophone Harmonization of Count Basie's "Sent For You Yesterday"

> _Reference score_: Mark Harvey arrangement (unpublished).  
>   
> Write chord symbols (chord identifications) for all the notated chords on this example. Do this in RSF in concert key.

Assignment 4: Composition
-------------------------

Please write an original melody for the basic chords on the AABA form of "I Got Rhythm." If you are experienced with this form, you may use some altered and/or substitute chords. If less experienced, you should stay with the basic chord progression.

Write a full harmonization for one of the A sections, assuming you have four saxophones. (One of these will be the main melody, the other three are supporting voices.) For a second A section, write a four part comping pattern. For the B section, please write a counterline of some sort. (The melody is one voice, the countermelody is given to a second voice.) Do this in RSF (two stave, concert key format).

Assignment 5: "Early Autumn"
----------------------------

_Reference score_ : Burns, Ralph. "Early Autumn." Milwaukee, WI: Hal Leonard Corp., 1996.

This assignment relates to a classic swing era composition, "Early Autumn," written by Ralph Burns for the Woody Herman Orchestra of the late 1940s. Please do the various parts of this assignment as indicated. The model for your work will be what we have done today in class with another Herman classic, Jimmy Giuffre's "Four Brothers."

1\. Transpose the saxophone parts ("Tenor Band" version) to concert score format. Your score set-up will have five staves, four for the individual saxes, and one for the guitar part with the chord symbols. Do this transposition **only** for the sections indicated.

*   Pick up notes, and mm. 1 - 3, in their entirety.
*   mm. 4: only the first sixteenth note, right on beat two & both eighth notes on beat four
*   mm. 5: the full measure
*   mm. 6: only beat four
*   mm. 7: only beats one and two (the half note)

2\. When the transposed sax & guitar score is completed, then analyze and identify all the chords—"post" chords and all passing chords. Please note these above each vertical configuration on your score.

Midterm Composition Project
---------------------------

A thirty-six measure original composition written for five saxes, piano and bass. (Drums may be optional.) Full Score in concert key. Parts transposed as appropriate. All sketches should be in RSF for review and discussion with instructor.

### For Saxes

Minimum of 8 mm of block harmony (note for note), 8 mm of support-style block harmony, 8 mm of countermelodic writing, and if you wish, no more than 4 mm of unison.

### For Piano and Bass

Rhythm section support role primarily. Any specific notes should be kept to a minimum. Parts will be primarily hash marks with chord symbols.

### Solo with Background / Optional

You have the option of writing 8 - 12 mm of this piece as a solo for one instrument, during which the others play backgrounds of some sort, e.g., riffs, pads, etc.

**Form and structure**
{{< tdclose >}}

{{< trclose >}}
{{< tropen >}}
{{< tdopen colspan="2" >}}
You may choose to work with standard forms (blues, 32 bar song form) or a form of your own devising. Your structure should be well thought-out in terms of design, shape, orchestration, use of solo improvisational segments, and other aspects.
{{< tdclose >}}

{{< tdopen colspan="2" >}}
**Texture and voicing**
{{< tdclose >}}

{{< trclose >}}
{{< tropen >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
Monophonic texture
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
Use of a single instrumental line, or of a unison line, are worth consideration and can often be effective. However, please be sure that any such usage is not excessive.
{{< tdclose >}}

{{< trclose >}}
{{< tropen >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
Homophonic texture
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}


There must be evidence of full ensemble block harmony and a soli section, typically for the saxes. The minimum of block harmony required is 16 mm.

**Analysis**: One of these segments must have all chords, including passing chords, identified. The segment should be between 8 - 12 mm. long. Please do this on a separate page of music paper.

{{< trclose >}}
{{< tropen >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
Polyphonic texture
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
There must be evidence of countermelodic writing. This may be in terms of a melody line with one counterline, or, if you wish, a passage with three-part counterpoint. The minimum amount of countermelodic writing required is 16 mm.

{{< trclose >}}
{{< tropen >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
Voicings
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}


In the block harmony sections, there must be evidence of attention to voicing considerations as we have studied them, i.e., you should be thinking in terms of the Basie or the Thad Jones approach, for example, or in terms of modal or other approaches we have discussed.

**Analysis**: One segment of your block harmony must have the voicing configurations identified as done in the "Moten Swing," "Kids are Pretty People,"and "St. Louis Blues" exercises. The segment should be between 6 - 8 mm. long. Please do this on a separate page.

{{< tdopen >}}
Solo improvisation
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
You should allow for some solo improvisation in your piece. With a standard form and structure (e.g., Basie, Jones, etc.) please include backgrounds as part of this solo section. With a different form and structure, please include something similar. In any case, do not have long stretches of solo improvisation with only rhythm section accompaniment.
{{< tdclose >}}

{{< trclose >}}
{{< tropen >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
Dynamics and articulations
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
There should be varied dynamic markings in your piece. The use of crescendo and decrescendo effects are encouraged as well. There should be varied articulation markings in your piece.
{{< tdclose >}}

{{< trclose >}}
{{< tropen >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
Tempo and rhythmic feels
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
Any and all meter indications must be clearly marked. You need not make metric shifts, but if you do, these must be clearly marked and carefully designed for ease of performance.

Meter
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
In the block harmony sections, there must be evidence of attention to voicing considerations as we have studied them, i.e., you should be thinking in terms of the Basie or the Thad Jones approach, for example, or in terms of modal or other approaches we have discussed.
{{< tdclose >}}

{{< trclose >}}
{{< tropen >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
Horn sections
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
There should be evidence of use of all of the sections as sections as well as the use of the full ensemble.
{{< tdclose >}}

{{< trclose >}}
{{< tropen >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
Rhythm section
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}


The rhythm section will primarily perform a supportive function, e.g., comping for piano, walking or patterned lines for bass, and time keeping for drums. Hash marks and other simple, direct indications are preferred.

If you wish to have any of the rhythm section parts work with the other sections or full ensemble, this should be kept to a minimum and be clearly indicated. For example: bass doubling bari sax line; piano doubling horn lines; drums doing fills alternating w/full ensemble rhythmic support. All are possible but must be dealt with carefully.
